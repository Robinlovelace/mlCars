# Introduction

## Context

## Outputs

- Demonstration of how official datasets can be augmented with geographical data from OpenStreetMap.

- Application of Machine Learning algorithms to widely available transport datasets.

- Write-up on the policy implications of the research.

- A tutorial on Big Data and Machine Learning targetted at transport planners, consultancies and policy-makers relatively new to data science.

> - An R package, **mlCars** containing the source code and example data to ensure reproducibility.

## What is big data?

Big data is an ubrella term.

> "**unconventional**  datasets  that  are  **difficult**  to  analyze
**using established methods**. Often this difficulty relates to **size** but the form, format, and **complexity** are equally important" [@lovelace_big_2016].

## What is machine learning?

-  From the report: 

> "By machine learning, we mean simply that the functional form of the model is not specified by the user" 

There are 2 main types of machine learning [@hastie_elements_2016]:

> "[Either] supervised or unsupervised. In supervised learning, the goal is to pre-
dict the value of an outcome measure based on a number of input measures;
in unsupervised learning, there is no outcome measure, and the goal is to
describe the associations and patterns among a set of input measures."

Many transport problems can be framed as supervised ML problems.

# Data and methods

## Open access official data

## OSM data

## Classical statistical methods

## Machine Learning

## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

# Policy implicaitons

## Machine Learning and Big Data for the Transport Sector
- Machine learning and big data present new opportunities for the transport sector.

- Big data and machine learning offer the promise of more efficient and cheaper transport models based on rich, finely-grained data across a wider range of indicators.

- However, they should not supplant domain expertise or contextual knowledge in transport policy and planning. They are best used as aides to human decision-making rather than replacements.

- Barriers to the effective and ethical uptake of innovative new technologies in transport include: access to skills, investment in R&D and organisational culture.

## The Policy Implications of Car Dependency
- Car dependency is the cause of a variety of social, environmental and economic issues. 

- Creating more sustainable regions by reducing car dependency and developing multi-modal mobility requires a multi-faceted approach that involves both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ policy interventions.
