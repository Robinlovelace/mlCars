## What is car dependency?

Car dependency should be easy to define: a measure of the extent to which people *depend* on their cars.
But what does this actually mean?
Unless your car doubles as a life-support system, it is unlikley that you literally depend on it for survival.
More likely you depend on the car for trips that are *seen as essential*, for modern life.
Whether it's for doing the 'weekly shop', dropping children off at school or taking a sick relative to hospital at an affordable, car use can easily become integral modern life.

Of course, each of these trips could have either been made by a different mode or not made at all and (except potentially in the case of taking a relative to hospital) nobody would die.
Car dependency is thus about observed behaviour than hypothetical consequences of going *cold turkey*.
The analogy of a drug dependency is useful.
Drug dependents will not die if they can no longer indulge their addition.
But life will be hard, at least for a while after, when they stop.
Similarly, those who are car dependent will find it hard to adjust to life after their car has been taken away.

From a policy perspective car dependency is problematic due to its negative consequences, not in its own right. 
Notwithstanding questions of whether government policy encourages car dependency, 


It is important to note that car dependency is not necessarily 

## Established methods for car dependency research

There is a long history of reasearch into the concepts of car dependency and, more broadly, mode choice.
