Using Machine Learning and Big Data to Model Car Dependency: an Exploration Using Origin-Destination Data
================

This project explores the potential for emerging methods in Big Data and Machine Learning to be applied to transport modelling, with a focus on car dependency at the origin-destination level.

Installing it, after a recent version of R and the package **devtools** have been installed, should be as simple as typing and then executing the following command:

``` r
devtools::install_github("robinlovelace/mlCars")
```
