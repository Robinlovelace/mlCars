```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=curl::has_internet()}

This project explores the potential for emerging methods in Big Data and Machine Learning to be applied to transport modelling, with a focus on car dependency at the origin-destination level.

Installing it, after a recent version of R and the package **devtools** have been installed, should be as simple as typing and then executing the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("robinlovelace/mlCars")
```
